# 1.4 Branch
This Branch is devoted to the development of v1.4 of OpenGameInstaller. This update will allow for addons to ask for inputs before performing tasks, as well as add support for game libraries.

# OpenGameInstaller
A game installation platform built with developers in mind.

**This project does NOT directly condone piracy of any kind. I made OpenGameInstaller to let people easily download games from different store fronts and I want to let developers have control over the download process.**

# What is this
This is the npm workspace which stores all of the packages required for OpenGameInstaller, including the front-facing GUI `application`, a library to interface with the Real-Debrid API `packages/real-debrid`, and a library to interface with OpenGameInstaller's addons platform `packages/ogi-addon`.

**READMEs are in each package to describe how to use them.**

The LICENSE of each of these packages are in their directories.
