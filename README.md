# OpenGameInstaller

A game installation and management platform built with developers in mind.

**Using third-party addons is your responsibility. We at OpenGameInstaller are not responsible for the content you download with our utility. Please download responsibly.**

# How To Install

Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Nat3z/OpenGameInstaller/releases/latest) and download the "OpenGameInstaller-Setup.exe" file (x86_64 only). This will install the auto-updater to keep the application up-to-date.
