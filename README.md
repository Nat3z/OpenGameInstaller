# OpenGameInstaller
A game installation platform built with developers in mind.

**This project does NOT directly condone piracy of any kind. I made OpenGameInstaller to let people easily download games from different store fronts and I want to let developers have control over the download process.**

# What is this
This is the npm workspace which stores all of the packages required for OpenGameInstaller, including the front-facing GUI `application`, a library to interface with the Real-Debrid API `packages/real-debrid`, and a library to interface with OpenGameInstaller's addons platform `packages/ogi-addon`.

**READMEs are in each package to describe how to use them.**

The LICENSE of each of these packages are in their directories.
