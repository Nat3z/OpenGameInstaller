Adding your addon to the Community Addons list is the best way to get your addon to users.

# Steps

1. Go and [fork](https://github.com/Nat3z/OpenGameInstaller/fork) our GitHub repository. 
1. Navigate to `web/community` and copy the **template.md** file.
1. Fill out the details for your addon and provide a **BRIEF** description of your addon.
1. Now, go to the [Pull Request](https://github.com/Nat3z/OpenGameInstaller/compare) composer and attach your fork of the repository.
1. Title the PR with: `[submission] {addon title}` and provide a description as to what your addon does.
1. Once everything is verified, the addon is merged to the main repository.

# Guidelines

* No explicit images.
* No links to other sites in description.
* No modifying other addons.
* You **must own** the addon in order to add it to the community listing.
