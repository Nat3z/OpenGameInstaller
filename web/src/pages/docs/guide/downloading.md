Downloading content on OpenGameInstaller relies on a catalog addon to provide metadata about the game you are downloading and a source search addon to provide the actual download links.

## Important Notes

OpenGameInstaller does not host any game files. We solely provide tooling to help addons integrate their source's download links or content into our client. We are not responsible for the content provided by addons, and we do not endorse any specific source or content.

## Downloading Content

Once you have a proper catalog and source search addon installed, you can search for games in the search bar or Discovery tab. On the side of the game's store page, you will see a list of sources that provide download links for the game. You can click on any of the links to start the download process.

### Note on Downloading

When you click on the "Download" button, OGI will immediately start trying to download the game to your download location. If you have concerns about torrenting, refer to the download type at the top right of the source before you download.
