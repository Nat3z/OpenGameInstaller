## What is OpenGameInstaller?

OpenGameInstaller (OGI for short) is a platform for downloading, installing, and managing
video games. We provide a user interface for you (the user) to browse, install, and
manage your games. Developers then use the tools we give them through our platform to create
storefronts, game downloads, and setup scripts for those games, creating an all-in-one
extensible gaming platform.

### What are we NOT?

We are NOT a video game distribution platform. We don't host any content on our servers nor
do we provide tools to help with breaking copyright laws. We at OpenGameInstaller are not
responsible for content downloaded on our platform and we do not take any logs of games downloaded
or addons downloaded on our platform.
