OpenGameInstaller is a video game management and installation platform. It is built off of an addon ecosystem, and uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as its primary runtime for addons.

## Why does this documentation exist?

The Documentation provided here will help developers with making their first addons, as well as document best practices for programming OpenGameInstaller addons. Example addons with varying functionality are provided as well, getting you ready with **thinking with addons!**
<br></br>

Start developing by going to [Your First Addon](/docs/first-addon) and read the guide that shows the entire process of making an OpenGameInstaller addon!
